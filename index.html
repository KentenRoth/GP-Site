						<h2>What Does It Do?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="secondary-content">
						<p>
							The automated garden is a simple setup that will
							track the soil's moisture level, and when it gets
							too low, it will trigger motors to water the plant.
							I use a raspberry pi 4 8GB to run the code, control
							everything, and use a raspberry pi 2b+ as an SQL
							server. Every hour the moisture levels are checked,
							and that data is sent to the other raspberry pi to
							be stored. Also, when the water motors turn on, the
							date and time are stored on the server.

						<h2>The Basics</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="secondary-content">
						<p>
							This project was something that I thought would be
							simple but turned into something a lot more. I
							wanted to use NodeJS, and there is not much
							information out there on using Node with a raspberry
							pi. After some digging, I was able to find different
							NPM libraries to help me with this project. I did
							not feel that any of the libraries had
							well-developed documentation, so there was some
							trial and error to get things working.
						</p>
						<p>
							I use one library to send signals from the GPIO pins
							and one library to use the ADS1115 chip. The GPIO
							pins power the breadboard that runs the ADS1115
							chip. I could have had everything running off the
							JBtek power supply but did not want the breadboard
							to feel clustered. Also, the GPIO pins will get the
							data from the ADS1115 chip and turn the relay
							switches on and off. The JBtek power supply would
							give power to the water motors and the moisture
							sensors.
						</p>
						<p>
							When getting readings from the sensors, I would get
							numbers between 1300 and 2500. The lower the number,
							the more moisture that was in the soil. This messed
							with me a little because, in my mind, it should have
							been the opposite. I did not include, but would
							when/if I rebuild this project, and do it on a large
							scale, would be to add checks to ensure the sensors
							are working as expected. I would need to monitor the
							sensor readings to ensure it would not keep watering
							because the sensor was faulty.

						<h2>Why Did I Build This?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="secondary-content">
						<p>
							The main reason for this project was to do something
							with the raspberry pi's I had sitting around
							collecting dust. I enjoy doing things in the garden,
							but I can only do that for part of the year, and
							sometimes in the winter months, fresh lettuce or
							herbs would be nice. I also wanted to use this time
							to get a better understanding of SQL and Websockets.
							This is the first project that I have put together
							using MySQL or Websockets, so I enjoyed learning
							these things. I learned other things along the way,
							like soldering, breadboards, and the GPIO pins on
							the raspberry pi, but the coding portion was my main
							focus for learning.
